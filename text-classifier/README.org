#+TITLE: Text Classification in Tensorflow

* Introduction

This repo contains text classification models.
1. Word-level CNN model https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882
2. Char-level CNN model adapted from https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06615

* Dependencies

- Python3.6
- TensorFlow 1.6
- Numpy
- tqdm, show progress bar in an unobtrusive way
- nltk, tokenize strings.
- bleach, remove HTML tags.

Sample data are stored in [[file:data/][data]] directory.  The preprocessing script is provided
in [[file:data_utils/][data_utils]].  To use your own test classification set, please prepare your
data set into the following format:
1. Store training and test samples for each category in separate files.  Let's
   say your data set has 6 categories, then prepare your data set into
   =train-0.txt=, =train-1.txt=, ..., =train-5.txt=, =test-0.txt=, =test-1.txt=,
   ..., =test-5.txt=, where the number indicates the labels.
2. Each sample reside in a line.
3. Create a pipeline script following the examples in [[file:data_utils/][data_utils]], e.g.,
   [[file:data_utils/prepare_imdb.bash]].
4. Run the pipeline script, it should generate an =.npz= file containing the
   training and test dataset.
5. Create classifier model following the examples, e.g., [[file:charcnn_imdb.py]].
