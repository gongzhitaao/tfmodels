Tensorflow Models
=================

> What I cannot create, I do not understand.  -- Feynman

This repo contains TensorFlow re-implementation of interesting models from
random papers I read.  I use the low-level API as much as possible since
research models almost never fit into the standard API.

## Getting Started

Personally I use [*editable installs*](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs) (i.e., `python install -e
path/to/tfmodels`) to install the modules locally in a virtual environment
created with [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  It should be easy to integrate code from
this repo to your project simply by copy-and-paste.
